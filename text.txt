The main difference with machine learning is that just like statistical models,
the goal is to understand the structure of the data â€“
fit theoretical distributions to the data that are well understood.
So, with statistical models there is a theory behind the model that is mathematically proven,
but this requires that data meets certain strong assumptions too.
Machine learning has developed based on the ability to use computers to probe the data for structure,
even if we do not have a theory of what that structure looks like.
The test for a machine learning model is a validation error on new data,
not a theoretical test that proves a null hypothesis.
Because machine learning often uses an iterative approach to learn from data,
the learning can be easily automated.
Passes are run through the data until a robust pattern is found.
